A component must always have a render method

Export defualt;
only one defualt allowed per file


<Hello/> is JSX

Looksl like XML

Has self closing tag

MAKE IT DYNAMIC
Pass in data where the component is rendered

.props that passes properties through the component
represents tdate the will the the same on every render

.state reps data that will change depending on actions of the user

values stored in a components state are utable
we can access state values using this.state.

=> = anonymous function
